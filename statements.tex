\section{Statements}
The generalization of statements over container type uses different quantification
of the predicates and elements in its meaning.

Where unary parametricity is the forall predicate forall elements statement
which states that every predicate of the type arguments is satisfied for 
all elements in the container, other predicates using a notation
of exists are imaginable.

Especially the exists predicate exists element statement will be useful.
This statement postulates that for one of the predicate there is 
an element in the container satisfying the predicate.
For example $\exists\exists_{\text{List}}~X~P_X~xs$ states for a list $xs:\text{List}~X$
that there is an element $x\in xs$ with $P_X~x$.

Additionally, other combinations such as a $\exists\forall$ or $\forall\exists$ statement
are possible.

The conjunction can be represented by a single constructor with multiple arguments.
Similarly the disjunction can be represented by multiple single argument constructors.
